# target_dice_game

This is a really simple python program in which there are 2 players (user and computer).
Both user and computer gets to roll the dice.
Whoever reaches the target first or whose score is greater than the other -> WINS!!
But if at anny point if the dice rolls to 1, the net score becomes 0.
